The statistical models repository is contained the model or analysis, which are not apart of IFRS 9 or Credit Risk. This


Those twos have seperated repositories, which can be visited

## Time series model
* Bayesian linear regression is an approach to linear regression in which the statistical analysis is undertaken within the context of Bayesian inference ***(bayesian_linear_regression.ipynb)***

## Dimensionality reduction

## Statistic analysis / technique
* MICE: Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations ***(MICE.ipynb)***
* SHAP values are used to explain individual predictions made by a model ***(SHAPInterpreter.ipynb)***
